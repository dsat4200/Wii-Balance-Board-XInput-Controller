## Ever wanted to control a game while also working out? 
This repo is for you. it is a customizable, remappable xinput mapper for the wii balance board. It uses standard python blueototh and HID libraries. Made specifically for a specific rhythm game i wanted to play, so I can't guarantee it'll fit your needs, but feel free to fork it.
